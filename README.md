# AlphaGoBang - implement AlphaZero in gobang game

AlphaGoBang is a pure Python project that uses TensorFlow to 
implement the AlphaZero algorithm based on neural networks and search trees on the game.

### Aims
Our goal is to simulate the implementation of its neural network for the arrival of Alpha Zero shortly before. In detail, based on the Monte Carlo search tree and Resnet neural network technology, 
the results of the gobang game were trained and simulated.
